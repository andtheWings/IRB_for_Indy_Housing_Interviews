## Enrollment/Randomization {.page_break_before}

Recruiters for this study will initially identify study participants by one of the following methods:

- Referral from local stakeholders working for organizations in domains like community development or housing advocacy
    - Such organizations include but are not limited to:
        - Reclaim Indiana Avenue
        - Near Northside Development Corporation
        - Ransom Place Neighborhood Association
        - Homes for All Indy
        - Westside CDC
- Referral from residents of the neighborhoods of interest
- Direct solicitation within neighborhoods of interest
- Self-referral by participants after seeing advertisements on paper flyers or social media

We will recruit using email advertisements, phone calls, social media, or socially-distanced, in-person communication. When possible, we will ask for introductions via common acquaintances to aid in credibility.  Participants will be directed to a landing page explaining the nature of the study and asked to provide their contact information.  We will reach out to participants via preferred method of contact (phone/email/text) and coordinate a time and location to meet.

As a qualitative study, there will be no randomization procedure. We will enroll study participants until we have reached saturation for the themes listed below, which we estimate to be approximately 15-30 people.

Consent by web form or written form will always be obtained prior to starting the interview.
