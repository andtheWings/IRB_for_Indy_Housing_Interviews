## Privacy/Confidentiality Issues {.page_break_before}

Because interviews will be recorded by cloud transcription software, only pseudonyms will be used for participants and no granular location data will be solicited. The part of the interview regarding social connections will be performed at the end without recording. A record linking transcripts to IDâ€™s will be stored in an encrypted file to which only the PI and key personnel will have access. Consent documents, including those allowing us to share data publicly will be submitted for IRB approval.
