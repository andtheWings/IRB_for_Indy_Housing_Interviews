## Follow-up and Record Retention {.page_break_before}

This study is oriented around using its interviews to build up a social network of housing stakeholders in Indianapolis. We will engage these stakeholders in future efforts to achieve their common vision for housing change. If that vision is indeed consistent with the formation of a CLT, we will use quantitative surveys to solidify consensus around key aspects of corresponding bylaws and articles of incorporation. Records will be retained indefinitely for use by the community in either de-identified or public form depending on the wishes of individual participants.
