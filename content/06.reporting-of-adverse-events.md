## Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems involving Risk to Participants or Others {.page_break_before}

Given the sensitivity of housing issues--especially around eviction and homelessness--we will take the utmost care to maintain privacy. Should any personal information be unintentionally disseminated, we will offer a timely report of the incident to the participant in question. The report will include details regarding how the event took place, how we will act to prevent similar events in the future, suggested mitigating steps, and how we plan to offer support should the participant want it.
