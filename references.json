    "abstract": "Redlining - the discriminatory practice by which banks refuse or limit mortgages to people of color, ethnic minorities, and low-income workers within specific geographic areas - still defines much of where we live or can live in Indianapolis. These federal policies, established by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation in 1933, reinforced segregation and disinvestment in parts of the community, with ramifications felt today, particularly in Black neighborhoods. \nWhat do disciminatory housing practices look like in our city? How can equitable housing policies change that trajectory now? Join us for a series of interdisciplinary community discussions with advocates, leaders, and scholars to examine the tangled roots of race, class and housing in Indianapolis and grapple with its consequences today. \nMaking it Local with Unai Miguel Andres, Paul Mullins, Wildstyle Paschall, and Stacia Murphy. Explore what redlining looks like here in Indianapolis, considering history, demographics, and memory.",

The data show that renter housing needs have grown substantially – almost totally because of unaffordably high rents rather than physical deficiencies – and that federal housing assistance is far from keeping up. The number of low income renters that actually receive federal housing assistance has dropped notably as a fraction of the low income households that need it. From the evidence available now, it seems almost certain that this gap will continue to worsen over the next several years.",
